## Introduction

Positive psychology is a branch of psychology that focuses on what makes life worth living. Unlike traditional psychology, which often centers on disorders and pathologies, positive psychology emphasizes strengths, resources, and positive experiences.

## Foundations of Positive Psychology

Positive psychology is built on several pillars: gratitude, optimism, resilience, and engagement. These elements are essential for improving well-being and quality of life.

### Gratitude

Expressing gratitude daily strengthens social relationships and increases happiness. Studies show that keeping a gratitude journal improves mental health.

### Optimism

Optimism helps overcome difficulties and see opportunities in every situation. Optimistic people are generally more motivated and successful in their projects.
