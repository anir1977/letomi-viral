# You Remember Events Wrong (and It’s Not Your Fault)

**Meta description:** Your memories feel real, but they are stitched together. Discover why your brain rewrites events and how it changes your life.

## Introduction
Think of your memory like a great storyteller, not a perfect recorder. It fills in gaps, edits scenes, and sometimes swaps details without asking. The result? You can feel 100% certain about moments that never happened the way you recall.

## The Focus Keyword: memory distortion
Memory distortion is not a glitch; it is a feature that helps your brain work fast and keep you safe. But it can also lead you to swear by details that are wrong. Understanding why that happens makes you more accurate, not less confident.

## Your Brain Is a Prediction Machine
Your brain is built to predict, not to archive. That sounds dramatic, but it makes daily life smoother:

- It uses patterns to fill in missing details.
- It compresses experiences into easy-to-recall “gist” memories.
- It trades precision for speed because speed kept us alive.

That is great when you are walking through a crowded street and need to react quickly. It is not great when you are trying to remember exactly what someone said in a tense conversation.

### The “Gist vs. Detail” Trade-Off
You remember the plot, not the script. Over time, the “gist” gets stronger, and the details fade. That is why siblings can tell the same family story but disagree on the specifics.

## Why Confidence Doesn’t Equal Accuracy
Confidence is a feeling, not a fact. You can be totally confident and still mistaken. Researchers have found that confidence often rises when:

- You have rehearsed a memory by telling it often.
- The memory matches your beliefs about yourself.
- You’ve seen photos or heard other people’s versions.

The story becomes smoother and more vivid, which feels like truth, even when parts have shifted.

## The Sneaky Role of Suggestion
Memory is surprisingly easy to nudge. Ask a question with one extra word and the memory can change. For example, “How fast was the car going when it **smashed** into the other car?” makes people remember higher speeds than “when it **bumped** into.”

### Why This Matters in Real Life
Suggestion doesn’t only show up in labs:

- Leading questions in interviews can reshape what a witness recalls.
- Social media threads can create a shared story that feels personal.
- Family storytelling can merge multiple people’s memories into one “official” version.

## You Actually Update a Memory Every Time You Recall It
When you remember something, it becomes flexible for a short window before it “re-saves.” That means each recall can edit it. A new detail gets stitched in, or a missing detail gets replaced by something plausible.

Think of it like opening a file, making small changes, and saving over the original. Your brain is doing the same thing, every time you replay a moment.

## Emotion Makes Memories Feel Clearer (But Not Always Truer)
Strong emotion makes memories *feel* vivid. That is why we have “flashbulb” memories of major events. But vivid doesn’t mean accurate. Under stress, your attention narrows. You might remember the loud sound or the face, but miss the surrounding details.

### The Tunnel Effect
When emotions spike, your brain zooms in on the main threat or goal. That helps survival. It also means your memory of the full scene can be blurry or warped.

## Practical Ways to Be a More Reliable Rememberer
You do not need to distrust your brain. You just need to work with it.

- **Write it down fast.** Journaling within a day helps preserve details.
- **Avoid leading questions.** Ask “What happened?” not “Did he yell?”
- **Compare sources.** If the memory matters, verify it with texts, photos, or other people.
- **Pause before arguing.** Treat a memory dispute as an investigation, not a trial.

## The Social Side of Memory Distortion
Memory distortion shapes arguments, relationships, and even the stories we tell about ourselves. When two people disagree about the past, it is not always because someone is lying. They might be reconstructing the same event differently.

That can be freeing. It means you can be wrong without being dishonest. It also means you can be right without being cruel.

## Conclusion
Your memory is not a camera. It is a living story that changes with every retelling. That is not a failure; it is a feature that helps you navigate the world. The win is knowing this—and being a little gentler with yourself and others when your memories do not align.

## Quick Recap
- Memory distortion is common and normal.
- Confidence does not guarantee accuracy.
- Suggestion can reshape what you remember.
- Emotion makes memories vivid, not necessarily precise.
- Writing things down quickly preserves details.

# The Banana Radiation Myth Is True (But Don’t Panic)

**Meta description:** Bananas really are radioactive. Learn the science, the “banana equivalent dose,” and why it is more fun than scary.

## Introduction
Yes, bananas are radioactive. That sounds like a prank until you hear the reason: potassium. But the bigger surprise is how safe they are and why scientists turned this quirky fact into a teaching tool.

## The Focus Keyword: banana radiation
Banana radiation comes from potassium-40, a natural isotope that exists in the bananas you eat every day. It is real, measurable, and completely harmless in normal amounts.

## The Science in Plain English
Potassium is essential for life. Your body needs it to regulate nerves and muscles. Most potassium is the stable kind, but a tiny fraction is potassium-40. That isotope gives off a small amount of radiation as it decays.

### So How Much Radiation Is That?
Not much. A banana has around 0.1 microsieverts of radiation. For context:

- A dental X-ray: about 5 microsieverts
- A cross-country flight: 30–40 microsieverts
- Natural background radiation per day: 10 microsieverts

You would need to eat millions of bananas at once to approach anything dangerous. And at that point, your stomach would have far bigger issues.

## The Banana Equivalent Dose (Yes, That’s a Real Thing)
Scientists use “banana equivalent dose” as a playful way to explain radiation. It makes a scary topic feel more relatable. Instead of saying “40 microsieverts,” they can say “about 400 bananas.”

### Why It Sticks
- It turns a scary idea into a silly one.
- It creates a concrete mental image.
- It teaches scale, which is the real story in radiation.

## Why This Doesn’t Build Up in Your Body
The body is smart. When you eat potassium, it balances levels by excreting extra. So even if you eat bananas daily, the potassium-40 doesn’t keep stacking like a comic book villain.

In short: your body regulates potassium, and your potassium levels stay steady.

## The Bigger Lesson: Natural Doesn’t Mean Zero
Many people assume “natural” equals “no radiation.” But the world is full of gentle, natural radiation:

- You are radioactive (thanks, potassium and carbon-14).
- Granite countertops emit tiny amounts.
- The air contains radon in low concentrations.

The key is dose. A tiny amount is normal and expected.

## The Psychology of Fun Facts
Why do people love this? Because it’s surprising and safe. “Bananas are radioactive” flips a mental switch. It makes science feel alive, not sterile.

This is the kind of fact that gets shared because it sparks curiosity without fear.

## Should You Worry About Eating Bananas?
No. Bananas are nutritious, affordable, and safe. The radiation angle is just a fun way to highlight how the physical world works.

If anything, it is a reminder to question scary headlines and look for the numbers behind them.

## Conclusion
Banana radiation is real, but it is tiny. The fact is entertaining because it is true, but also because it teaches scale, perspective, and how easily we misunderstand risk.

## Did You Know?
- Your body naturally contains about 4,000 “banana doses” worth of potassium-40.
- A flight across the ocean equals hundreds of bananas in radiation.
- Radiation is measured in *dose*, not just presence.

# Overthinking Isn’t a Personality Trait. It’s a Loop.

**Meta description:** Overthinking feels like problem-solving, but it traps you in a loop. Learn the psychology and how to break free.

## Introduction
Overthinking can feel productive. You replay the conversation, analyze the tone, plan the response. But instead of clarity, you get stuck. The loop tightens, and you call it “being thorough.”

## The Focus Keyword: overthinking psychology
Overthinking psychology looks at why the brain keeps circling the same thoughts. It is not a personality flaw. It is a learned pattern that can be changed.

## Why the Brain Loves Loops
Your brain hates uncertainty. When something feels unresolved, it keeps it open like a browser tab. The goal is safety: find the right answer, avoid regret, prevent a mistake.

### The Problem
Not all problems have a neat solution. The loop keeps spinning even when there is nothing new to add.

## The Difference Between Reflection and Rumination
Reflection is useful. It has an end point. Rumination doesn’t. It feels like analysis, but it is mostly repeating the same content with a rising emotional charge.

Ask yourself:

- Am I moving toward a decision?
- Am I generating new options?
- Do I feel calmer or more tense?

If tension keeps rising, you are likely ruminating.

## The Hidden Triggers
Overthinking often spikes after:

- Social interactions (“Did I say something weird?”)
- Big decisions (career, relationships, money)
- Low sleep or high stress

When your body is stressed, your mind becomes sticky. It clings to worries because it thinks vigilance equals safety.

## The “Control Illusion”
Overthinking gives you the *feeling* of control. If you analyze long enough, you might prevent a bad outcome. But real control comes from action, not endless mental rehearsal.

### Small Action Beats Perfect Thought
A tiny action breaks the loop: send the email, make the call, decide a boundary. Action closes the mental tab.

## How to Break the Cycle (Without Going Blank)
You do not need to “stop thinking.” You need to shift the pattern.

- **Name the loop.** “I’m ruminating.” It creates distance.
- **Set a timer.** Give yourself 10 minutes to think, then decide or park it.
- **Externalize.** Write it down. The brain relaxes when it sees the problem stored.
- **Ask one concrete question.** “What is the next smallest step?”

## The Role of Self-Compassion
Overthinking thrives on self-criticism. The more you judge yourself, the more you analyze. A gentler inner voice reduces the need to “prove” you are safe.

You are not behind. You are just human in a world that is loud and uncertain.

## Conclusion
Overthinking feels like protection, but it can become a trap. The way out is not willpower; it is pattern change. Name it, externalize it, and take a small action. That is how the loop loosens.

## Quick Recap
- Overthinking is a loop, not a trait.
- Rumination repeats; reflection resolves.
- Stress and uncertainty make the loop stronger.
- Action closes open mental tabs.

# Your Eye Color and Your Personality: What Science Actually Says

**Meta description:** Do blue eyes mean you are calmer? Brown eyes more trustworthy? Here’s what research shows about eye color and personality.

## Introduction
Eye color is one of the first things people notice. It feels like it should mean something about you. But does it? Science has looked at this question, and the answers are more nuanced than the internet claims.

## The Focus Keyword: eye color personality
The idea of eye color personality is popular because it is easy to remember. But research suggests any links are small and often shaped by culture, stereotypes, and perception.

## What the Studies Really Find
Some studies show mild correlations between eye color and traits like assertiveness or risk-taking. But correlation is not destiny. The effects are usually weak and depend on the sample.

### Why Findings Are Inconsistent
- Eye color varies by region and ancestry.
- Personality is influenced by environment, not just biology.
- People treat you differently based on appearance, which shapes behavior.

## The Power of Stereotypes
If a culture believes light eyes are “softer” and dark eyes are “stronger,” people might respond to you differently. Over time, those responses can shape your self-image and behavior.

This is not magic. It is social feedback loops.

## Perception vs. Reality
Studies on perceived trustworthiness show that faces with light eyes are often rated as “gentler,” while dark eyes are rated as “stronger.” But these are *perceptions*, not truths.

### Your Eyes Don’t Dictate Your Choices
Personality grows from:

- Early environment
- Family dynamics
- Social learning
- Personal experiences

Eye color can influence first impressions. It does not write your life story.

## The Genetics Angle (A Quick, Clean Version)
Eye color is influenced by multiple genes, not a single switch. That is why two brown-eyed parents can sometimes have a blue-eyed child and vice versa. It is complex and beautiful, but it doesn’t map neatly to behavior.

## So Why Does This Topic Go Viral?
Because it is personal. People want to feel seen and understood. A simple “eyes = personality” story is easy to share, even if it is shaky.

The reality is more interesting: you are shaped by a mix of biology, culture, and your own choices.

## Conclusion
Eye color can influence how people perceive you, but it is not a personality predictor. If you enjoy the fun of the idea, keep it playful. If you want truth, remember that personality is far more layered than pigment.

## Did You Know?
- The same eye color can look different in different light.
- Cultural stereotypes change across countries, altering perception.
- Most traits are influenced by dozens of genes and years of experience.

# Why You Never Remember the Beginning of Your Dreams

**Meta description:** You can recall the weird middle of a dream but never the start. Here’s why your brain loses the opening scene.

## Introduction
You wake up with a dream in your head, but it feels like you jumped into it halfway. The opening scene is gone. That is normal—and there is a real reason your brain drops it.

## The Focus Keyword: dream memory
Dream memory is fragile because it depends on how the brain stores information during sleep. The beginning is the first part to fade.

## Your Brain Is Not Recording During Sleep
Memory storage relies on certain brain regions working together. During REM sleep, the part that handles logical sequencing is less active. That makes dreams rich and emotional, but harder to file into stable memory.

### The “Wake-Up Gate” Problem
The moment you wake up, your brain switches modes. If you don’t grab the dream right away, it evaporates fast.

## The Beginning Is the Weakest Link
The start of the dream happened earlier in the sleep cycle. That makes it more distant by the time you wake. The end is fresher, so you remember it more easily.

Think of it like a conversation you overheard: you remember the last sentence, not the first.

## Sleep Cycles Matter
Dreams are strongest in late-night REM periods. If you wake during one of those, you remember more. If you wake between cycles, the dream memory slips away.

### Why Alarm Clocks Wreck Dream Recall
Alarms jolt you out of REM. Your brain shifts into alert mode and drops the dream file to handle the new task: get up.

## How to Remember Dreams Better
If you want to capture them:

- **Stay still on wake-up.** Movement disrupts recall.
- **Repeat the dream.** Say it in your head before grabbing your phone.
- **Write it down fast.** Even a few words anchor the memory.

## The Emotional Glue
Emotions are strong in dreams. That’s why you may remember the feeling even when the plot is missing. Your brain stores the emotion as a shortcut, but the storyline fades.

## Conclusion
You don’t remember the beginning of your dreams because your brain isn’t built to file them in order. It stores emotion and fragments, not full scripts. If you want more, catch them quickly or they will slip away.

## Quick Recap
- Dream memory is fragile and fast-fading.
- The beginning happens earlier and fades first.
- Alarms and quick movement erase recall.
- Writing down fragments helps preserve them.

# The “Face Memory” Myth: Why You Forget People You Just Met

**Meta description:** You are not rude—you are human. Learn why face memory fails and how to remember names and faces better.

## Introduction
You meet someone, smile, say their name, and five minutes later it’s gone. It feels embarrassing. But your brain wasn’t built to store every new face on command.

## The Focus Keyword: face memory
Face memory is a specialized system, but it is selective. It prioritizes relevance, emotion, and repetition—none of which are strong during a casual introduction.

## The Brain’s Face System Is Powerful but Picky
Humans are excellent at recognizing familiar faces. But we are not great at *encoding* new faces. That requires attention, context, and time.

### The “One-Glance” Myth
We assume one glance is enough. It usually isn’t. If you are distracted or nervous, encoding gets worse.

## Why Names Are Even Harder
Names are abstract. There is no visual hook. Unless you connect the name to something meaningful, it slips away.

Try:

- Repeating the name aloud.
- Linking the name to a visual cue.
- Using the name in a sentence right away.

## The Role of Stress and Social Pressure
Social settings can make you hyper-aware. That stress steals attention from memory. You are thinking about what to say next, not the face in front of you.

## How to Improve Face Memory (Without Tricks)
These are simple but effective:

- **Slow down the introduction.** A few extra seconds matter.
- **Notice a unique feature.** A scar, a smile, a voice pattern.
- **Create a mini-story.** “Jake with the red backpack who loves hiking.”

## It’s Not Rude to Forget
Most people forget names and faces. The difference is how they handle it. A quick, honest “Sorry, I forgot your name” is better than faking it.

## Conclusion
Face memory is not broken. It just needs attention and context. When you slow down and make the moment meaningful, your brain can store it.

## Did You Know?
- People are worse at recognizing faces of unfamiliar groups, a bias called the “other-race effect.”
- Repeated exposure builds face memory quickly.
- Sleep consolidates face recognition after social events.

# The Science of “Why Time Feels Faster as You Age”

**Meta description:** Time didn’t speed up—your brain changed. Discover the psychology of time perception and how to slow it down.

## Introduction
As a kid, summers felt endless. As an adult, a year can fly by. It feels like time is accelerating, but the clock isn’t changing—your brain is.

## The Focus Keyword: time perception
Time perception depends on attention, novelty, and memory density. As these change with age, time starts to feel faster.

## The “Novelty Effect”
New experiences create more memories. More memories make a period feel longer in hindsight. When life becomes routine, you form fewer distinct memories, so months compress.

### Why Childhood Felt Huge
Childhood is packed with “firsts.” Each first creates a rich memory chunk, which makes the past feel long and detailed.

## Attention Shapes Time in the Moment
When you are bored or anxious, time drags. When you are engaged, time flies. That is because attention is the core of time perception.

## The Memory Density Trick
In retrospect, time feels longer when you can recall many events. So the way to “slow time” is to increase memory density.

## How to Make Time Feel Slower
You can shift your perception with simple choices:

- **Add novelty.** Try a new route, recipe, or hobby.
- **Break routines.** Even small changes create new memory anchors.
- **Journal highlights.** Writing down moments makes them easier to recall.

## The Hidden Role of Stress
Stress makes time feel weird. In the moment, it can slow time, but in hindsight it can blur memories. Chronic stress often reduces novelty and makes weeks feel merged.

## Conclusion
Time isn’t speeding up. Your attention and memory patterns are shifting. If you want life to feel longer, make it richer in experiences, even in small ways.

## Quick Recap
- Time perception is shaped by attention and novelty.
- More memories make time feel longer in hindsight.
- Small changes can “slow” your sense of time.

# Why Your Brain Hears Your Name in a Noisy Room

**Meta description:** The “cocktail party effect” explains why your name cuts through noise. Here’s the science behind selective attention.

## Introduction
You’re in a loud room, half-listening, when suddenly you hear your name. It feels like magic, but it is actually a feature of attention called the cocktail party effect.

## The Focus Keyword: cocktail party effect
The cocktail party effect is your brain’s ability to focus on one signal while still monitoring the background for important cues—like your name.

## Attention Is a Filter, Not a Wall
Your brain filters most noise, but it keeps a small channel open for high-priority information. That is why you can be deep in conversation and still notice your name.

## Why Names Are Special
Your name is linked to identity and social relevance. Your brain assigns it a higher priority tag. So even when you are not “listening,” it still pops through.

## The Survival Angle
In ancestral environments, ignoring background noise would be dangerous. Your brain evolved to scan for threats and social cues while focusing on one task.

## The Limits of This Superpower
Selective attention is not perfect. If you are exhausted, stressed, or distracted, the filter weakens. That is why you can miss your name sometimes.

## Can You Train This?
You can sharpen attention by:

- Practicing mindfulness or focused listening.
- Reducing multitasking.
- Getting enough sleep, which resets attention systems.

## Conclusion
Hearing your name in a noisy room is not magic. It is your brain’s way of keeping you socially aware and safe, even when you think you are tuned out.

## Did You Know?
- People are more likely to notice their name than other words of the same length.
- Sleep deprivation weakens selective attention significantly.
- The effect fades if your name is overused in spammy contexts.

# The “Left Brain vs. Right Brain” Myth That Won’t Die

**Meta description:** Are you logical or creative? The left brain vs. right brain story is more myth than science. Here’s what’s real.

## Introduction
You have probably been told you are a “right-brain creative” or a “left-brain logical” person. It is catchy and simple. It is also mostly wrong.

## The Focus Keyword: left brain right brain myth
The left brain right brain myth suggests that one hemisphere dominates your personality. Modern neuroscience shows that both sides work together on almost everything.

## Where the Myth Came From
Early research found that certain functions are more *localized*. Language is often more left-lateralized, for example. But that does not mean your left side runs your life.

## The Brain Is a Team Sport
Most tasks involve networks across both hemispheres. Creativity uses logic. Logic uses creativity. When you solve a problem, both sides cooperate.

## Why the Myth Persists
It is simple and flattering. It offers people a quick identity label. But it can also limit you by implying you are “not the type” for certain skills.

## What You Can Say Instead
If you want to be accurate:

- Talk about *skills* rather than brain sides.
- Mention that different tasks activate different networks.
- Focus on practice and growth, not fixed labels.

## Conclusion
You are not trapped in a left-brain or right-brain identity. Your brain is flexible and networked. The myth is catchy, but the truth is better—and more empowering.

## Quick Recap
- The left/right brain story oversimplifies neuroscience.
- Most tasks use both hemispheres.
- Labels can limit growth more than help it.

# The Strange Reason You Feel a Buzz When You Clean

**Meta description:** Cleaning can feel oddly satisfying. Learn the psychology behind the “cleaning buzz” and why it calms the mind.

## Introduction
Have you ever cleaned your room and suddenly felt lighter, calmer, maybe even energized? That feeling is real. There are deep psychological reasons why cleaning can feel so good.

## The Focus Keyword: cleaning psychology
Cleaning psychology explores why order and control affect mood. It is about stress, reward, and your brain’s love of clear signals.

## Order Gives Your Brain a Rest
Clutter creates low-level stress. Your brain keeps noticing the mess, even if you are not consciously thinking about it. When you clean, the noise drops.

### Visual Load Matters
Every object in your field of view pulls a tiny bit of attention. Fewer objects mean fewer micro-decisions, which means more mental space.

## The Reward Loop of Completion
Cleaning gives you a fast win. You can see the result. Your brain loves visible progress, and it rewards you with a hit of satisfaction.

## Control in an Uncertain World
When life feels chaotic, cleaning gives you a pocket of control. It is a small, manageable task with clear boundaries. That sense of control can reduce anxiety.

## Why Music Makes It Even Better
Music turns cleaning into a rhythm. It reduces friction and increases focus. It is a simple way to make the task feel less like a chore and more like a ritual.

## How to Use Cleaning as a Mental Reset
Try this:

- Set a 10-minute timer.
- Pick one small area.
- Focus on clearing surfaces first.
- Stop when the timer ends.

You get a win without burnout.

## Conclusion
Cleaning feels good because it lowers visual stress, gives you control, and delivers a quick reward. It is not just about a tidy room—it is about a calmer mind.

## Did You Know?
- Studies show cluttered environments increase cortisol.
- Short cleaning bursts can improve mood within minutes.
- Visible progress activates reward pathways in the brain.

# The “Phantom Vibration” Phenomenon: Why You Feel Your Phone Buzz

**Meta description:** You feel a phone buzz that never happened. Learn the psychology behind phantom vibrations and why they are so common.

## Introduction
You swear your phone buzzed. You reach for it. Nothing. You are not losing it—phantom vibrations are extremely common, especially in the age of constant notifications.

## The Focus Keyword: phantom vibration
Phantom vibration is a sensory misfire caused by attention, expectation, and habit. Your brain is primed to detect alerts, so it sometimes invents one.

## The Brain’s Prediction Habit
Your brain predicts signals based on patterns. If you get many notifications, your brain starts expecting them. That expectation can trigger a false sensation.

## Why It Feels So Real
The sensation is vague and brief, which makes it easy to misinterpret. Clothing pressure, muscle twitches, or slight movements can feel like a buzz.

## Anxiety and Anticipation Make It Worse
If you are waiting for a message, you are more likely to feel phantom alerts. That is your brain on high alert, scanning for cues.

## It’s Not a Disorder
Phantom vibrations are not a diagnosis. They are a normal byproduct of modern life. The brain adapts quickly to habits, even digital ones.

## How to Reduce It
If it bothers you:

- Turn off nonessential notifications.
- Change where you keep your phone.
- Take short breaks from your device.

## Conclusion
Phantom vibrations happen because your brain is tuned to your phone. It is a modern illusion, not a personal flaw. Changing habits can quiet it down.

## Quick Recap
- Phantom vibration is common and normal.
- Expectation and habit drive the sensation.
- Reducing notifications reduces false alerts.

# The Hidden Bias in “People Watching”: Your Brain’s Fast Judgments

**Meta description:** We judge strangers in seconds. Discover the psychology behind snap judgments and how to make them more accurate.

## Introduction
You see someone across the room and instantly form an opinion. It feels natural. It is also biased. Your brain is built to make fast judgments, and speed often beats accuracy.

## The Focus Keyword: snap judgments
Snap judgments are quick impressions based on limited cues—like posture, facial expressions, and style. They help you navigate social life, but they can mislead you.

## Why Your Brain Does This
Fast judgments save energy. They also helped our ancestors detect threats. The issue is that modern social life is more complex, and the same shortcuts can create unfair assumptions.

## The Halo Effect
If someone looks confident or attractive, we often assume they are also competent or kind. That is the halo effect. It is powerful and mostly unconscious.

## The Dangers of First Impressions
First impressions shape how we interpret later behavior. Once you decide someone is “cold,” you notice evidence that confirms it and miss evidence that doesn’t.

## How to Slow the Bias
You can’t shut off snap judgments, but you can correct them:

- **Pause.** Notice the first impression without acting on it.
- **Ask a new question.** What might I be missing?
- **Collect more data.** One conversation is not a full picture.

## Why This Matters in Real Life
Snap judgments affect hiring, friendships, and even how we treat strangers. A small pause can reduce a big bias.

## Conclusion
Your brain is fast, not always fair. Snap judgments are normal, but you can learn to soften their edge and see people more clearly.

## Did You Know?
- People form first impressions in under 100 milliseconds.
- Smiling faces are judged as more trustworthy, even when unrelated to behavior.
- Awareness alone reduces the strength of the halo effect.
