## How Fast Do We Judge?
Research shows we form first impressions in just 7 seconds—or even less!

## What Influences First Impressions?
Facial expressions, body language, and even clothing play a huge role in how we’re perceived.

## Can You Change a First Impression?
It’s possible, but it takes time and consistent behavior to override that initial judgment.

## Why It Matters
First impressions affect job interviews, friendships, and even dating. They can open doors—or close them.

**Tip:**
Be aware of your body language and smile—it’s your best first impression tool!
