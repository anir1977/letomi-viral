## Why Do We Smile?
Smiling is a universal language. Scientists say it’s hardwired in our brains and helps us connect with others.

## The Science Behind Smiling
When you smile, your brain releases dopamine and serotonin—chemicals that make you feel happier and less stressed.

## Smiling Is Contagious
Studies show that seeing someone smile activates mirror neurons in your brain, making you want to smile too.

## Health Benefits
Smiling can lower your heart rate, reduce pain, and even boost your immune system.

**Did You Know?**
Smiling can trick your brain into feeling happier, even if you fake it!
